# My_Little_Pony_Maze
You must help the pony to find the maze's exit.<br>
One level per pony, 6 levels.<br>
The three firsts are basics, and you can change from one to another with button.<br>
The fourth is taller.<br>
The fifth implement the scrolling system. The screen go with the player.<br>
The sixth have an enemy. If you are next to him he hunt you.<br>
The Dijkstra algorithm was implemented to help the IA to find the player.<br>
Each turn the map is cut as a graph arround the enemy's position to find a path.<br>
A lot of multi-threading and synchronising to do that.
